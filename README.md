## 📋 What You'll Need

Before you start, make sure you have:

1. **Docker Desktop** - [Download here](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and make sure it's **running**
2. **VS Code** - [Download here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. **Dev Containers extension** - [Install from VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
4. **Git configured with SSH** - See the SSH setup guide below
5. **Supabase credentials** - Ask the project owner for these (you'll need a URL and API key)

> **New to Dev Containers?** Don't worry! They're just a way to give everyone the exact same development environment. Think of it like a pre-configured computer in a box. Everything you need is already installed inside.

---

## 🔑 SSH Setup for Git (First-Time Setup)

**Why do you need this?** To push and pull code from GitHub, you need SSH keys. The dev container automatically shares your SSH keys from your computer.

### Do you already have SSH keys?

Check if you already have SSH keys on your computer:

**On Mac/Linux:**
```bash
ls -la ~/.ssh
```

**On Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
dir $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh
```

**If you see files like `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub` (or `id_ed25519` and `id_ed25519.pub`)**, you're all set! Skip to [Quick Start](#-quick-start-5-minutes).

### Creating SSH Keys (If You Don't Have Them)

**Step 1: Generate your SSH key**

Open your terminal (Mac/Linux) or PowerShell (Windows) and run:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your.email@example.com"
```

Replace `your.email@example.com` with your actual email.

**What you'll see:**
- `Enter file in which to save the key`: Just press **Enter** (uses default location)
- `Enter passphrase`: Press **Enter** for no passphrase (easier for development), or enter a passphrase (more secure)
- `Enter same passphrase again`: Press **Enter** again (or re-enter your passphrase)

You'll see something like:
```
Your identification has been saved in /Users/yourname/.ssh/id_ed25519
Your public key has been saved in /Users/yourname/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

**Step 2: Add your SSH key to GitHub**

1. **Copy your public key:**

   **On Mac:**
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | pbcopy
   ```

   **On Linux:**
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   # Copy the output manually
   ```

   **On Windows (PowerShell):**
   ```powershell
   Get-Content $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_ed25519.pub | Set-Clipboard
   ```

2. **Add it to GitHub:**
   - Go to [GitHub SSH Keys Settings](https://github.com/settings/keys)
   - Click **"New SSH key"**
   - Give it a title (like "My Laptop")
   - Paste your key in the "Key" field
   - Click **"Add SSH key"**

3. **Test your connection:**
   ```bash
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```

   You should see: `Hi username! You've successfully authenticated...`

**Step 3: Configure git (if you haven't already)**

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

✅ **You're all set!** The dev container will automatically use these SSH keys.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Get the Code

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maxasseily/accountability-app.git
cd accountability-app
```

### Step 2: Open in VS Code

```bash
code .
```

VS Code will open the project folder.

### Step 3: Reopen in Dev Container

You'll see a popup in the bottom-right corner that says:

> **"Folder contains a Dev Container configuration file. Reopen folder to develop in a container?"**

Click **"Reopen in Container"**.

**Didn't see the popup?** No problem:
1. Press `F1` (or `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux, `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac)
2. Type: `reopen in container`
3. Click **"Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"**

**What's happening now?**
- VS Code is building your development environment (takes 2-5 minutes the first time)
- It's installing Node.js, React Native tools, and all project dependencies
- **Your SSH keys are automatically mounted** from `~/.ssh` (so git push/pull will work)
- You'll see a progress notification at the bottom-right
- ☕ Grab a coffee while you wait!

### Step 4: Start Local Supabase

The project uses **local Supabase** for development - a complete backend running on your computer!

**Start the local database:**

In the VS Code terminal (it opens at the bottom automatically), run:

```bash
npx supabase start
```

**What's happening:**
- Docker is starting up a local Supabase stack (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Studio)
- First time takes 2-3 minutes (downloading Docker images)
- Future starts are much faster (~30 seconds)
- ☕ Grab a coffee while you wait!

You'll see output like:
```
Started supabase local development setup.

         API URL: http://127.0.0.1:54321
          DB URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres
      Studio URL: http://127.0.0.1:54323
```

### Step 5: Configure Your Environment

**Get your local credentials:**

```bash
npx supabase status -o env
```

This shows your local Supabase credentials:
```
SUPABASE_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:54321
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

**Create your `.env` file:**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

**Add your credentials:**

1. Open the new `.env` file (you'll see it in the file explorer on the left)
2. Copy the anon key from `npx supabase status -o env` and add the `EXPO_PUBLIC_` prefix:
   ```bash
   # IMPORTANT: Use your computer's IP address for BOTH URLs (not 127.0.0.1!)
   EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=http://192.168.1.42:54321  # Replace with YOUR computer's IP
   EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...

   # Your computer's IP address (same as above)
   REACT_NATIVE_PACKAGER_HOSTNAME=192.168.1.42  # Replace with YOUR computer's IP
   ```
3. **Find your computer's IP address** and use it for BOTH settings (see Step 6 below)
4. Save the file (`Ctrl+S` or `Cmd+S`)

> **Critical:** The `.env` file is already set up to be ignored by git automatically.

**Port Forwarding (Automatic):**
The devcontainer automatically forwards these ports from the container to your computer's network interface:
- `8081` - Metro Bundler (Expo dev server)
- `54321` - Supabase API (accessible at your computer's IP)
- `54323` - Supabase Studio (web UI - open in browser: `http://127.0.0.1:54323`)

**Understanding IP Addresses:**
- **Your phone needs your computer's IP for EVERYTHING**: Use the same IP (like `192.168.1.42`) for both Supabase URL and Metro hostname
- **Why not `127.0.0.1`?**: That's localhost - on your phone, `127.0.0.1` means the phone itself, not your computer
- **Port forwarding**: The devcontainer makes Supabase accessible at your computer's network IP (`0.0.0.0:54321`)
- **Your browser**: Can still use `http://127.0.0.1:54323` to access Studio UI locally

**In simple terms:**
- `127.0.0.1` = "this device" (your phone or your computer)
- `192.168.1.42` = "your computer on the network" (accessible from your phone)

### Step 6: Find Your Computer's IP Address

**Why do you need this?** Your phone needs to know where to find BOTH Metro Bundler AND Supabase running on your computer. You'll use the same IP address for both `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `REACT_NATIVE_PACKAGER_HOSTNAME`.

**Important:** Your phone cannot access `127.0.0.1` - that refers to the phone itself. Port forwarding makes Supabase accessible at your computer's network IP address (like `192.168.1.42:54321`).

**On Mac:**
1. Open Terminal (outside the dev container - use your Mac's terminal app)
2. Run: `ifconfig`
3. Look for the `en0` section
4. Find the line starting with `inet` (NOT `inet6`)
5. The IP address looks like `192.168.1.xxx` or `10.0.0.xxx`
6. Copy this address

Example:
```
en0: flags=8863<UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING>
    inet 192.168.1.42 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.1.255
```
In this example, your IP is `192.168.1.42`

**On Windows:**
1. Open PowerShell or Command Prompt
2. Run: `ipconfig`
3. Look for "Wireless LAN adapter Wi-Fi" (if using WiFi) or "Ethernet adapter" (if using cable)
4. Find the line that says `IPv4 Address`
5. The IP address looks like `192.168.1.xxx` or `10.0.0.xxx`
6. Copy this address

Example:
```
Wireless LAN adapter Wi-Fi:
   IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.1.42
```
In this example, your IP is `192.168.1.42`

**Add it to your .env file:**
```bash
# BOTH lines need your computer's IP address
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=http://192.168.1.42:54321
REACT_NATIVE_PACKAGER_HOSTNAME=192.168.1.42
```

**Important notes:**
- Your IP address might change if you restart your router or move to a different WiFi network
- Make sure your phone is on the **same WiFi network** as your computer
- If you can't connect later, check if your IP changed and update BOTH URLs in the `.env` file
- **Use your computer's IP for BOTH settings** - not `127.0.0.1`

### Step 7: Start the App

In the VS Code terminal, run:

```bash
npm start
```

You'll see a QR code in the terminal. You have three options:

**Option A: Test on Your Phone (Recommended)**
1. Install **Expo Go** app on your phone ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent))
2. **Make sure your phone is on the same WiFi network as your computer**
3. Scan the QR code with your camera (iOS) or the Expo Go app (Android)
4. The app will load on your phone!

> **Can't connect?** Double-check that:
> - You set `REACT_NATIVE_PACKAGER_HOSTNAME` in your `.env` file (see Step 4 above)
> - Your phone is on the **same WiFi network** as your computer
> - Your IP address is correct (it may have changed)

**Option B: Test in Web Browser**
- Press `w` in the terminal

**Option C: Test in Emulator**
- Press `a` for Android or `i` for iOS (requires additional setup)

**Where to start coding:**
- **Add a new screen?** → Create a new file in `app/`
- **Change colors/theme?** → Edit `src/utils/colors.ts`
- **New button or input?** → Look in `src/components/ui/`
- **Modify login logic?** → Check `src/context/AuthContext.tsx`
- **Change database schema?** → Create migration in `supabase/migrations/`
- **Photo upload logic?** → Check `src/utils/dailyPhoto.ts`
- **Group features?** → Look in `src/utils/groups.ts` and `src/context/GroupContext.tsx`

---

## 🎨 The Design System

The app uses a futuristic dark theme:

- **Colors**: Deep blue/purple gradients with bright cyan accents
- **Style**: "Glassmorphism" - frosted glass effect on cards
- **Buttons**: Gradient backgrounds with glow effects
- **Inputs**: Semi-transparent with glowing borders when focused

All colors are defined in `src/utils/colors.ts` - change them there to change the entire theme!

## 🐛 Something Not Working?

### Git says "Permission denied (publickey)"

**This means the dev container can't access your SSH keys.**

**Fix:**
1. Make sure you've set up SSH keys following the [SSH Setup guide](#-ssh-setup-for-git-first-time-setup) above
2. Make sure your SSH keys are in the default location: `~/.ssh/` (Mac/Linux) or `C:\Users\YourName\.ssh\` (Windows)
3. Rebuild the dev container: Press `F1` → type `rebuild container` → Select **"Dev Containers: Rebuild Container"**

**Still not working?**
- Check file permissions on your SSH folder:
  ```bash
  # On Mac/Linux (run outside the container):
  chmod 700 ~/.ssh
  chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
  chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
  ```
- Make sure you added your SSH key to GitHub (see SSH Setup guide)

### "Can't connect to Metro bundler" or "Can't connect to server"

This usually means your phone can't find the development server on your computer.

**Fix:**
1. **Make sure your phone is on the same WiFi network as your computer** (this is the most common issue!)
2. **Check your IP address hasn't changed:**
   - On Mac: Run `ifconfig` and look for `inet` under `en0`
   - On Windows: Run `ipconfig` and look for `IPv4 Address`
3. **Update your `.env` file** with the correct IP address in BOTH `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `REACT_NATIVE_PACKAGER_HOSTNAME`
4. **Restart the server:**
   ```bash
   # Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
   npm start
   ```
5. **Scan the QR code again** with your phone

**Important:** If you see errors about Supabase connection, make sure:
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` uses your computer's IP (e.g., `http://192.168.1.42:54321`) - NOT `127.0.0.1`
- Supabase is running: `npx supabase status`
- Port forwarding is working (should be automatic in devcontainer)
- Your phone is on the same WiFi network as your computer

### "Container build failed" or Docker errors

**Fix:**
1. Make sure Docker Desktop is open and running
2. In VS Code, press `F1`
3. Type: `rebuild container`
4. Select **"Dev Containers: Rebuild Container"**

### App shows "Invalid API key" or login doesn't work

**Fix:**
1. Double-check your `.env` file has the correct credentials
2. Make sure there are no extra spaces or quotes
3. Stop Metro bundler (`Ctrl+C`) and restart: `npm start`

### Dependencies seem missing or code isn't working

**Fix:** Rebuild the container (it will reinstall everything):
1. Press `F1`
2. Type: `rebuild container`
3. Select **"Dev Containers: Rebuild Container"**
4. Wait for it to finish (2-5 minutes)

### Still stuck?

1. Make sure Docker Desktop is running
2. Try restarting VS Code
3. Check the **Troubleshooting** section below for more detailed help

## 🌳 Graphite Setup (Git Workflow)

This project uses **Graphite** for managing stacked pull requests and improving git workflow.

**Graphite is already installed** in the dev container, but you need to authenticate:

### First-Time Setup

1. **Get your Graphite auth token:**
   - Go to [graphite.dev/activate](https://graphite.dev/activate)
   - Sign in with GitHub
   - Copy your personal auth token

2. **Authenticate in the dev container:**
   ```bash
   gt auth --token <your-token-here>
   ```

3. **You're ready!** Now you can use Graphite commands like:
   ```bash
   gt create              # Create a new branch and track it
   gt submit              # Submit PR(s)
   gt stack               # See your stack of branches
   gt log                 # Enhanced git log
   ```

**Note:** Each team member must authenticate individually with their own token (don't share tokens).

**Learn more:** [Graphite Documentation](https://docs.graphite.dev/)

## 🔧 Useful Commands

### Working with Dev Containers

| What you want to do | How to do it |
|---------------------|--------------|
| Reopen project in container | `F1` → type `reopen in container` |
| Rebuild from scratch | `F1` → type `rebuild container` |
| Exit container, go back to local | `F1` → type `reopen folder locally` |
| See what's happening during build | `F1` → type `show container log` |

> **Tip:** You don't need to type the full command name. Just type a few letters like "rebuild" and it'll show up!

### Working with the App

```bash
# Start the app
npm start

# Clear cache and restart (if things are acting weird)
npx expo start -c

# Stop the app
# Press Ctrl+C in the terminal
```

**Note:** You no longer need to use `--tunnel` mode! The app connects directly to your computer's IP address (configured in `.env`).

## 🗄️ How Database Changes Work (Simple Explanation)

**Think of the database like a filing cabinet** - it stores all the app's information (user accounts, photos, settings, etc.).

The project uses **local-first development** - you have your own complete copy of the database running on your computer!

### When You Need to Change the Database:

Let's say you want to add a new feature, like "user preferences". You'd need to add a new drawer to the filing cabinet. Here's how it works:

**1. Make Changes Locally (On Your Computer)**
```bash
# Start your local copy of the database
npx supabase start

# Make your changes in the web interface
# Visit: http://127.0.0.1:54323
```

Think of this as making a draft on paper - you can experiment safely without affecting anyone else!

**Understanding the key commands:**

```bash
# npx supabase db reset - Safe! Local only!
# What it does: Wipes your local database clean and re-applies all migrations
# When to use: Before creating a PR, after pulling new code, when DB is in bad state
# Cannot hurt production: Only affects your computer
npx supabase db reset

# npx supabase db push - Dangerous! Affects production!
# What it does: Pushes changes directly to production database
# When to use: NEVER manually! Only via GitHub Actions with approval
# Why dangerous: Bypasses review, could break production immediately

# Note: Remember your .env should use your computer's IP:
# EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=http://192.168.1.42:54321 (not 127.0.0.1)
```

**2. Save Your Changes (Create Migration)**

When you're happy with your changes, the system creates a "migration file" - it's like writing down instructions for how to update the filing cabinet.

```bash
# Generate migration from your Studio UI changes
npx supabase db diff -f my_new_feature

# Test that migration works from clean state
npx supabase db reset
```

**3. Ask Your Team to Review (Create Pull Request)**

Create a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub. This is like asking your coworkers: "Hey, I want to add this new drawer to our filing cabinet. Does this look good?"

**What happens automatically:**
- ✅ GitHub Actions validates your migration files
- ✅ Supabase creates a preview database for testing
- ✅ Team can review and test your changes

**4. Someone Approves It (Code Review)**

A senior team member reviews your changes and approves the PR. They're making sure your new drawer won't mess up the filing system!

**5. Merge to Main (Triggers Deployment)**

After approval, you merge to the `main` branch. This triggers the production deployment workflow.

**6. Manual Approval Required (Protection Gate)**

GitHub Actions **pauses** and waits for a tech lead to approve the production deployment. This is the final safety check!

**7. Automatic Deployment (Safe Push)**

Once approved, GitHub Actions runs `npx supabase db push` automatically:
- ✅ Full audit trail in GitHub Actions logs
- ✅ Team visibility via notifications
- ✅ Proper authentication and error handling
- ✅ Everyone's app now has access to the new feature!

### Why This Workflow Is Safe:

- ✅ **You can't accidentally break things** - multiple approval gates before production
- ✅ **Test locally first** - `npx supabase db reset` ensures migrations work
- ✅ **Preview branches** - Test in cloud environment before production
- ✅ **Manual approval required** - Tech lead must approve production deployment
- ✅ **Full audit trail** - Every deployment logged in GitHub Actions
- ✅ **Everything is backed up** - we can always undo if something goes wrong
- ✅ **History is saved** - we can see who changed what and when

### Protection Layers:

1. **Local Testing**: `npx supabase db reset` validates migrations work
2. **Code Review**: Team reviews PR before merge
3. **Preview Branch**: Test in cloud before production
4. **Approval Gate**: Manual approval required for production
5. **GitHub Actions**: Automated deployment with full logging

### Key Commands for Developers:

```bash
# Start your local database (safe sandbox)
npx supabase start

# See what's running and get URLs
npx supabase status

# Get environment variables for .env file
npx supabase status -o env

# Stop the local database
npx supabase stop

# Create a new migration file
npx supabase migration new describe_your_change

# Test your changes locally (USE THIS OFTEN!)
# Resets DB and re-applies all migrations - verifies migrations work
npx supabase db reset

# Generate migration from Studio UI changes
npx supabase db diff -f feature_name

# ⚠️ NEVER run this command manually (use GitHub Actions instead)
npx supabase db push
```

**Quick workflow:**
```bash
# 1. Start local Supabase
npx supabase start

# 2. Make changes in Studio UI (http://127.0.0.1:54323)

# 3. Generate migration
npx supabase db diff -f my_feature

# 4. Test migration works from clean state
npx supabase db reset

# 5. If successful, create PR!
git add supabase/migrations/
git commit -m "feat: add my feature"
git push
```

### ⚠️ Important: Storage Buckets for Photo Uploads

When testing photo uploads locally, you must **manually create storage buckets** in Supabase Studio:

1. Start Supabase: `npx supabase start`
2. Open Studio: `http://127.0.0.1:54323`
3. Navigate to **Storage** → **New bucket**
4. Create bucket named `daily-photos` with:
   - **Public bucket**: ✅ Enabled
   - **File size limit**: 5MB
   - **Allowed MIME types**: `image/*`

**Note:** Storage buckets are NOT created by migrations and must be set up manually in each environment (local, staging, production).

## 🔒 Security Notes

- Your `.env` file contains secret credentials - **never commit it to git** (it's automatically ignored)
- The `.env.example` file is safe - it's just a template
- Don't share your Supabase credentials publicly
- User passwords are securely hashed (never stored as plain text)
- **SSH Keys**: Your `~/.ssh` folder is mounted into the dev container (read-only) so you can push/pull code. Your private keys never leave your computer.
